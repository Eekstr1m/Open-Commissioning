              Recruiting skilled personnel for heavy industry projects can be a
              daunting challenge for many organizations. This sector requires
              not only deep technical knowledge, but also a thorough
              understanding of the ever-increasing emphasis on Health, Safety,
              Environment and Quality (HSEQ) standards.

            <p>
              The pool of qualified candidates for short-term assignments
              remains limited and often lacks the job security and benefits
              associated with long-term positions.
